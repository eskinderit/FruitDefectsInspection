# FruitDefectsInspection - Computer Vision and Image Processing (IPCV) Exam.

- Course: Computer Vision and Image Processing
- Professor: Luigi Di Stefano
- Author: Alessandro D'Amico

The task consists in locating and isolating defects in two kind of fruits (apples and kiwis).

The task is divided in 3 subtasks:
  ##  First task
  detecting defects in the apples building a pipeline that takes advantage of the strong edges of the defects (this subtask is mostly involving operations on binary and grayscale images)
  ## Second task
  detecting defects (russet) in the apples building a pipeline that takes advantage of the typical reddish color (this task is mostly involving operations on color images - color segmentation - but also operations on the binary mask as done in the first task)
  ## Final task
  kiwis segmented using mostly the techniques described in the first task. 
  
In order to solve the subtasks, a mix of traditional IP and CV techniques has been applied in combination to my intuitive (handcrafted) ideas/function.
